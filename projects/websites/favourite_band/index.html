        <h2>Who Are The Gorillaz</h2>
        <P>Gorillaz are a English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The
            band primarily consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass
            guitar, replaced by Ace D. Copular while incarcerated), Noodle (guitar, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums
            and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through music videos, interviews, and other short
            cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, and often collaborates with other
            musicians.</P>
