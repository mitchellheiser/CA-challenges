        <h3>2D</h3>
        <img class="center" src="img/2d_profile.jpg" width=200px>
        <h4>character story</h4>
        <p>2-D was loosely inspired by a friend of Hewlett and Albarn who had worked with both Gorillaz and Blur.[2]

            Stuart Pot was born on May 23, 1978 to David and Rachel Pot. His father works as a mechanic and a
            fairgrounds worker, while his mother works as a nurse. He was born in Crawley, West Sussex, England, and
            attended St. Wilfrid's Catholic School. When he was 11 years old, Stuart was involved in an accident where
            he fell from a tree and hit his head. This caused all his natural brown hair to shed, until it eventually
            grew back in a deep azure blue color. The accident also caused him to experience frequent migraines, to
            which his mother supplied him with painkillers.

            At age 19, Stuart was hit in the face by Murdoc Niccals when he crashed his Vauxhall Astra into Uncle
            Norm's Organ Emporium, in an attempt to raid the store of its musical equipment. This caused Stuart to
            receive hyphema in his left eye and put him into a coma. Murdoc was then arrested and sentenced to 30,000
            hours of community service, as well as to care for the vegetabilised Stuart for 10 hours a week. Not long
            after, Murdoc injured Stuart again while pulling off 360 donuts to impress a small crowd of women. Stuart
            came crashing through the windshield of the car, and fractured his other eye. After the incident, he woke
            up from his vegetative state and was given the nickname "2-D", which refers to the two dents in his head.
        </p>
        <h4> Role as Musician</h4>
        <p>The character 2-D sings and plays the keyboard. He can play guitar, as can Murdoc, but both leave it to
            Noodle. In most cases, 2-D's singing voice is much lower than his warbly speaking voice. His vocal range is
            very wide, and he has sung everything from baritone to falsetto. All his singing voices are provided by
            Damon Albarn,[3] including the spoken verses in the 2005 hit "Feel Good Inc." 2-D apparently has had some
            influence in the lyric-writing process (as evidenced by the credits on the insert of the titular debut
            album) even though his intelligence is reputedly negligible. Apparently, Murdoc has had Albarn teach 2-D
            from time to time to sing better than he already could, and apparently even sing in some of their songs, as
            stated in an NME interview with Albarn

        <h3>Murdoc</h3>
        <img class="center" src="img/murdoc_profile.jpg" width=200px>
        <h4>character story</h4>
        <p>Murdoc Alphonce Niccals was born in Stoke-On-Trent on June 6th, 1966. Although the exact whereabouts were
            never verified, it was rumoured that his mother gave to birth him at the Belphegor Sanatorium, a halfway
            house for "the sick, the needy and the incredibly bored."
            Murdoc dreamt about becoming a famous musician and leaving Stoke-On-Trent. After becoming a Satanist, he
            began making deals with the devil and came to an arrangement with him. If Murdoc was to become a famous
            rock star, he would offer Satan his soul. When the deal was finalized, Murdoc acquired Satan's bass guitar
            "El Diablo" and his middle name was changed from "Alphonce" to "Faust".
            One day while skidding his car around a car park in Nottingham, Murdoc accidentally sent Stuart flying
            through the windshield into a curb, giving Stuart a fracture on his right eye, yet waking him up from his
            coma. Impressed by Stuart's appearance, describing him as "a blue haired, black eyed god", Murdoc recruited
            him as the lead singer and keyboardist for his band and gave him the nickname 2-D for the two dents in his
            head.
        </p>
        <h4>Role as Musician</h4>
        <p> Murdoc is the base guitarist and the leader/founder of the band</p>

        <h3>Noodle</h3>
        <img class="center" src="img/noodle_profile.png" width=200px>
        <h4>character Story</h4>
        <p>Noodle first came to the Gorillaz when they were a trio (composed of 2-D, Murdoc and Russel) after their
            original guitarist and 2D's girlfriend Paula Cracker was caught having sex with Murdoc in the toilets of
            Kong Studios, which resulted in her being thrown out of the band. As a result, the band was left needing a
            guitarist, so they ran an ad looking for one. The next day, a FedEx crate arrived at Kong Studios, and a
            little Asian girl popped out and started playing on her guitar, as 2-D later described it, "The riff to end
            all riffs". After shredding on her guitar, she spoke a single word to the trio, and it became her nickname:
            "Noodle".

            In 2003 Noodle visited Japan in an attempt to discover her past after being haunted by disturbing
            nightmares while on tour. While in a restaurant, she regained her lost memory after hearing the words
            'ocean bacon'. She coincidentally met with her mentor, Mr. Kyuzo, who was working as the head chef in the
            restaurant. Kyuzo helped her make sense of her lost memories: Noodle is, in fact, part of a secret
            government super soldier project, trained specially as a musician. As a result, she is a master of many
            weapons, languages, and musical instruments, with a specialty in the guitar, both as a musical instrument,
            and a weapon. Out of the 23 children created for the project, Noodle was the only one to survive; the
            others were all destroyed by the government when the project was scrapped
        </p>
        <h4>Role as Musician</h4>
        <p> Noodle is the guitarist of the band and sometimes the lead vocalist</p>

        <h3>Russel</h3>
        <img class="center" src="img/russel_profile.jpg" width=200px>
        <h4>Character Story</h4>
        <p>Russel was born in Brooklyn, New York on June 3, 1975. Known for his good manners and eloquent speech, he
            attended the Xavier School For Young Achievers, but was expelled after attacking several students while
            possessed by a demon. He fell into a coma for the next four years, at the end of which, the demon was
            finally exorcised from his body by a priest named Father Merrin.

            After his old school refused to take him back, Russel attended Brooklyn High School, where he befriended
            many of the students that were gifted in hip-hop music.

            One rainy night outside a 7-Eleven Store, Russel's companions were killed in a drive by shooting by a gang
            of "gang bangers" driving a black Humvee. They were all wearing red hooded tops. One of them was wearing a
            black hood who Russel identified as The Grim Reaper. After the shooting, the spirits of Russel's friends
            came to reside in his body, the most prominent being Russel's best friend Del tha Ghost Rapper.
        </p>
        <h4>Role as Musician</h4>
        <p> Russel is the drummer of the band and the ghosts trapped inside his body are the rap artist in the songs
            that have rap
